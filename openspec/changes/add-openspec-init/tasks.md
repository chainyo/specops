## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Add backend commands to check OpenSpec CLI availability at app launch, detect available package managers, install via npm/bun/yarn/pnpm, and run `openspec init` with selected parameters (including `--tools`).
- [ ] 1.2 Stream CLI output and status updates to the UI (progress, success, failure).
- [ ] 1.3 Add frontend init flow (missing OpenSpec action, init form that mirrors CLI choices, install prompt, and tools list fetched at init start).
- [ ] 1.4 Update project status and cache refresh after successful init.
- [ ] 1.5 Add tests for CLI check/install/init commands and UI state transitions.
